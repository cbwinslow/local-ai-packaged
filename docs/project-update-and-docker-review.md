# Project Update and Docker Review Report

## Project Tracking Tools Status
- **Overview**: Updates to Jira, Bitbucket, Linear, and GitHub require API access for comprehensive coverage (issues, boards, PRs, milestones). No direct access available in local workspace.
- **Current Status**: Blocked pending secure retrieval of API keys via planned chezmoi setup (see docs/secrets-setup.md). GitHub repo assumed local (no remote details provided); public views possible via browser if URL shared.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Manually export/log recent activity (e.g., new issues for Docker optimizations).
  - Post-secrets: Use GitHub API for Kanban export, issue sync.
  - Defer full update until access granted; document local changes here as proxy.

**GitHub-Specific Notes** (Pending Access):
- Projects: Sync local compose changes to issues/PRs.
- Issues: Open for "Docker Optimization", "Secrets Management"; closed for "Initial Setup".
- PRs: None visible; suggest creating for compose pins.
- Milestones: "v1.0 Stable" - target Docker security fixes.

## Docker Review Findings
Detailed analysis in docs/docker-optimization-plan.md. Key highlights:
- **Setup**: Multi-service Compose (AI tools, Supabase, observability); no custom builds, heavy :latest usage.
- **Optimizations**: Pin tags (e.g., n8n:1.62.0), multi-stage Dockerfiles for customs, resource limits.
- **Security**: Plan Trivy scans; non-root users, network isolation.
- **Workflows**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD (lint, scan, deploy).

## Action Items
- Implement Docker pins and CI/CD (switch to code mode).
- Resolve secrets for tracking sync.
- Run Trivy: `trivy image --format table $(docker images -q) > reports/trivy.md`.
