# Rules Overview

This Markdown file serves as a wrapper for the rules that the Roo Code system abides by, particularly for mode creation and documentation processes. It lists the full paths to the rules files in the project repository, based on the current environment configuration. These rules are stored in the .roo/rules-mode-writer/ directory and provide structured guidance for workflows, XML structuring, mode configurations, and instruction templates.

The rules ensure consistent, high-quality outputs by defining workflows, best practices, and templates for custom modes.

## Rules Files List

The following are the full paths to the rules files in the project repo:

- **Mode Creation Workflow**: /home/foomanchu8008/.roo/rules-mode-writer/1_mode_creation_workflow.xml
  - Content: Guides the step-by-step process for creating new custom modes, from requirements gathering to testing.

- **XML Structuring Best Practices**: /home/foomanchu8008/.roo/rules-mode-writer/2_xml_structuring_best_practices.xml
  - Content: Best practices for using XML tags in mode instructions for clarity, accuracy, and parseability.

- **Mode Configuration Patterns**: /home/foomanchu8008/.roo/rules-mode-writer/3_mode_configuration_patterns.xml
  - Content: Patterns and templates for different mode types (specialist, workflow, analysis, creative), permission patterns, and naming conventions.

- **Instruction File Templates**: /home/foomanchu8008/.roo/rules-mode-writer/4_instruction_file_templates.xml
  - Content: Templates for XML instruction files, including workflow, best practices, tool usage, and examples.

## Usage

These rules are loaded automatically in the Roo Code system for the Mode Writer mode. To view or edit a specific rules file, use the read_file or edit tools with the full path.

For more details on mode creation, see the individual XML files or the Mode Writer mode instructions.
