# Deployment Remediation Tasks

This file tracks prioritized tasks to resolve deployment issues identified in errors.md.

## Task 1: Resolve Docker Compose Service Conflicts
- **Description:** Investigate and fix the "services.grafana conflicts with imported resource" error. This likely occurs due to duplicate or conflicting service definitions between docker-compose.yml and override files (e.g., docker-compose.override.private.yml). Review all compose files, remove duplicates, and ensure proper merging.
- **Estimated Effort:** Medium (30-60 minutes)
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Status:** [x] Completed

## Task 2: Add Missing Environment Variables to .env
- **Description:** Address warnings for unset variables: GRAYLOG_PASSWORD, RABBITMQ_USER, RABBITMQ_PASS, FLOWISE_USERNAME, FLOWISE_PASSWORD, LOCALAI_API_KEY. Generate secure values and add them to .env file. Also check for any other missing vars from warnings like "j" and "l" (possibly typos or template vars).
- **Estimated Effort:** Low (10-15 minutes)
- **Dependencies:** Task 2 (generate additional secrets if needed)
- **Status:** [ ] Pending

## Task 3: Manually Clean Up Existing Containers and Volumes
- **Description:** Since the down command failed, manually stop and remove any existing containers, networks, and volumes for project 'localai' using docker commands (e.g., docker compose down -v --remove-orphans). This ensures a clean state for restart.
- **Estimated Effort:** Low (5-10 minutes)
- **Dependencies:** Task 1
- **Status:** [ ] Pending

## Task 4: Rerun start_services.py Script
- **Description:** After completing previous tasks, rerun `python3 start_services.py --profile gpu-nvidia --environment private` and monitor for new errors. Update errors.md if issues persist.
- **Estimated Effort:** Low (5 minutes)
- **Dependencies:** Tasks 1-3
- **Status:** [ ] Pending

## Task 5: Validate Service Startup and Connectivity
- **Description:** Once script succeeds, verify all services are running (e.g., using docker ps, logs), check inter-service connectivity, and perform basic health checks as per README.
- **Estimated Effort:** Medium (15-30 minutes)
- **Dependencies:** Task 4
- **Status:** [ ] Pending
