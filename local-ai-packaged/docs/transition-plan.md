# Transition Plan for Local AI Packaged Project

## Overview
This plan accelerates the project from its current prototype state (incomplete backend, manual deploys, no CI/CD) to a production-ready self-hosted AI platform. Focus: Complete codebase, automate workflows, integrate AI providers, and enable marketplace distribution. Environment: Kali Linux dev (apt-based, non-root containers); prod: Ubuntu server for stability.

## Phases and Timelines
- **Phase 1: Documentation & Task Setup (Week 1, Effort: 8-12 hours)**
  - Milestones: Generate docs (README, API guides), tasks.md, populate stubs (main.py, Dockerfiles).
  - Risks: Workspace inconsistencies (empty dirs); mitigate with git init/clone fresh.
  - Success: 100% docs coverage, tasks.md with 20+ items.

- **Phase 2: CI/CD Infrastructure (Week 2, Effort: 16-20 hours)**
  - Milestones: .github/workflows/ setup, Makefile extensions, custom actions (8+).
  - Risks: GitHub token perms; mitigate with OIDC for secrets.
  - Success: CI passes on PRs, CD deploys to staging (zero failures).

- **Phase 3: Integrations & Enhancements (Week 3, Effort: 20-24 hours)**
  - Milestones: Provider configs (OpenAI/HF/YAML), backend/frontend polish, docker-compose updates.
  - Risks: API key leaks; mitigate with Docker secrets/Vault.
  - Success: Dynamic provider swaps, E2E tests pass (Playwright/pytest), multi-arch builds.

- **Ongoing: Marketplace & Monitoring (Week 4+, Effort: 10 hours/month)**
  - Milestones: Release automation, monitoring (Prometheus in Compose).
  - Risks: Vendor lock-in; mitigate with local fallbacks (Ollama).
  - Success: Semantic releases, <5min deploys, 95% uptime.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Kali vs Ubuntu**: Dev on Kali, test on Ubuntu VM; use multi-stage Docker for compat.
- **Incomplete Codebase**: Stub generation; audit with pre-commit.
- **Secrets**: Never commit .env; use GitHub Secrets/actions.
- **Metrics**: Track via GitHub Insights (coverage, build time).

## Success Metrics
- 100% test coverage (pytest/vitest).
- Automated deploys (GitHub Actions).
- Onboarding time <30min (via docs/setup.sh).
- Provider integration: 4+ (OpenAI, HF, AWS, local).
