# Requirements for enhanced start_services.py orchestration script
# These are only needed for the enhanced functionality
# The basic Docker and Docker Compose functionality requires no additional Python packages

# No additional packages required - using only Python standard library
# This keeps the script lightweight and avoids dependency management issues

# If you need to add packages in the future, uncomment and modify as needed:
# requests>=2.25.0       # For HTTP connectivity tests
# paramiko>=2.7.0        # For enhanced SSH functionality  
# pyyaml>=5.4.0          # For YAML configuration parsing
